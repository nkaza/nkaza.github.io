      <title>Urban Development, Coastal Infrastructure and Policy </title>
      <link>https://nkaza.github.io/project/coastal-policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wind-swept, isolated beauty of coastal barriers has always attracted people. Coastal areas in general have undergone substantial population growth: from 1970 to 2010, the population of U.S. coastal counties increased by 34.8 million (39 percent).  During this time, many of these isolated outposts of sand have undergone a boom in second-home and resort development (Crawford, et al., 2013), with coastal counties issuing an average of over 1300 building permits each day between 2000 and 2010 (Crossett, et al., 2013). The increase in coastal population strains the carrying capacities of coastal land and water. The low elevation, narrowness, and shifting sands of coastal barriers make them high-risk places for development. It is not uncommon for houses on coastal barriers to be washed away, rebuilt, and then destroyed again by a subsequent storm (Salvesen 2005). Growing populations and increased development result in greater damage from natural disasters and greater difficulty in evacuating coastal residents, as past coastal storms have vividly illustrated (e.g., hurricanes Sandy and Katrina).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, the United States government has encouraged private development on coastal barriers through financial assistance for the construction of highways and bridges, water supply and wastewater treatment facilities, and beach stabilization projects (Glavovic and Smith, 2014; Burby, et al., 1999; Beatley, et al., 2002). Federal disaster assistance and flood insurance also have facilitated coastal development by transferring much of the risks and costs of development from the private sector to the public sector (DOI, 1983; Beatley, et al, 2002; Leichenko and Thomas, 2012). Significant literature –pertaining to coastal development as well as other hazardous areas such as floodplains – now argues that federal subsidies have perpetuated a cycle of subsidized development, destruction, and subsidized redevelopment (Berke et al., 2012). After a major coastal storm or hurricane sweeps across a coastal barrier, damaging or destroying homes, shops, roads, and water and sewer lines, federal disaster relief helps rebuild the damaged properties and infrastructure (Gillis and Barringer, 2012; Bagstad, et al., 2007; Burby, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to test the long-term effects of the withdrawal of development subsidies on development in coastal areas. Land markets respond to various kinds of signals about demand, supply, cost of construction, available tax credits, and subsidies. Growth controls – which can include development regulations or subsidy restrictions – are common local policy tools that have been shown to generallyincrease housing prices in the community (Elliot, 1981; Dowall and Landis 1982; and Katz and Rosen, 1987). While impacts on aggregate housing affordability depend upon the details of implementation, house value impacts of growth control policies are especially strong within the areas of control, making them a good indicator of policy effectiveness (Dawkins and Nelson 2002).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Urban Change &amp; Its Impacts</title>
      <link>https://nkaza.github.io/project/urban-change/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nkaza.github.io/project/urban-change/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is notoriously hard to measure and track &amp;lsquo;urban&amp;rsquo; as there are multiple dimensions to it; social, demographic, geographic, perceputal, environmental and  patterns of growth and decline. In this long standing research project, we seek to provide some novel ways of understanding our urban environments operate and change, and how those changes shape our behaviours. In doing so, we seek to understand the limitations as well as the suitability of measurements from various types of data streams (administrative to environmental sensors). By tracking the changes in these measurements, we seek characterise urban change around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.03.008&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McCarty &amp;amp; Kaza(2015)&lt;/a&gt; we used data from different air pollution sensors in a county to calculate the number of days with bad air quality in a year. We then relate it to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sia.planning.unc.edu/post/urban-morphology-landscape-metrics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;urban fragmentation metrics&lt;/a&gt; obtained from land cover data. We find that while counties with higher forest land area have higher number of polluted days. This effect is mitigated when these forests are closer to urban areas. Similarly, urban form measured as land use density or type or measured as geomorphometry have been shown to have different  on energy consumption patterns in cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, urban economy is also rapidly changing. One narrative of the cities argues for understanding and applauding the renaissance of cities during the decades of 1990s and 2000s (comeback cities). Another narrative suggest that this renaissance is highly uneven and is concentrated in innovative regions, while cities in the rest of the   regions (backwards) are loosing ground. To provide evidence for explanations and to disentangle the causes of these phenomena are some of the main motivations of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural outgrowth of this research is produce different plausible futures of urban form in different places. Since the configuration as well as the extent of urban form matter for climate as well as environmental outcomes, we seek to develop methods for projecting different futures based on various patterns, we observe in the past and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to expand the repertoire of urban areas to include areas from various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa and South America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Irregular settlements</title>
      <link>https://nkaza.github.io/project/irregular-settlements/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nkaza.github.io/project/irregular-settlements/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a third of the urban population in the world (~830 million) live in irregular/informal settlements/favelas/shanty towns/slums (United Nations Development Programme 2017). Whatever names these neighbourhoods take around the world, these settlements are at the core of many urban regions around the world; they provide affordable housing for urban poor but at high social and health costs. In urban areas, these types of settlements can constitute 30%-60% of the city and in some regions around the world, these settlements are the dominant urban form surpassing the formal settlements (Busgeeth et al. 2008; Kombe 2005). While denizens of these neighbourhoods may lack access to sanitation and other urban services or security of tenure, they tend develop bottom-up institutions (e.g. informal housing markets, vote banks) in myriad of ways that are interesting for students of urban politics and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to study these phenomena, we need to know where these settlements are and how they change over time. Because official estimates grossly undercount or ignore people in these settlements, it is hard to study them. Very little is known about how the settlements change over time and how quickly they are changing in response to contested claims by different groups (Roy 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, these settlements have distinct morphological characteristics. They are often associated with poor housing quality, cramped houses, uneven building heights, lack of sanitation and drinking water infrastructure, uneven quality of construction, lack of vegetative cover, small setbacks and narrow roads. The diversity of these areas pose a challenges for coming up with consistent monitoring and for creating robust methods for detecting and characterizing settlements (Kit, Lüdeke, and Reckien 2012; Taubenböck and Kraff 2013; Weeks et al. 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the availability of high quality, high resolution, high frequency satellite imagery, it is becoming increasingly possible to develop methods that will reduce the on-ground monitoring and data collection costs. The goal of this project is to map and validate the irregular settlements in entirety of  metropolitan areas in India. We are focusing on Bengaluru, Delhi, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Patna as the initial set of cities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Justifications for Planning</title>
      <link>https://nkaza.github.io/project/planning-theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nkaza.github.io/project/planning-theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we plan? And who plans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning is usually conflated with collective action, collective choice, communication, centralisation
and coordination. One of the central justifications for planning is to provide for public goods and to correct for externalities. I aim to show that these conflations and justifications are not only wrong. They provide neither a positive  nor a normative framework for understanding plans and planning. Plans need account for decision situations  that are fluid, uncertain, ambiguous and where decision-making authorities are fractured and have to be negotiated. The point of planning is to lay bare these complexities (to some extent) and allow us to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional practise of planning is not limited to planners employed in the public sector. But planning is an interaction that happens in a multi-organisational enviornment, where actors enter, leave and morph, and have different agendas and power relations. Such nuanced view of planning requires us to go beyond the conventional justificaitons of planning and to rethink the roles of planners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Local Energy Policy &amp; Planning</title>
      <link>https://nkaza.github.io/project/energy-policy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy, a quintessential private good, poses a conundrum for planners. The weaknesses of the argument that public goods are proper domain of planning become quite apparent, when we consider energy production and transmission infrastructure. Production of useful energy is a highly technical process, yet the political implications of such production and transmission inevitably draws planners into the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this thread of research, I seek to understand how traditional planning at the local and regional level wittingly and unwittingly intersect with energy production and consumption. In particular, I am interested in the idea that local governments can use their influence on urban form to influence energy production and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Smart Water Management and Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://nkaza.github.io/project/smartwater-iot/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://nkaza.github.io/project/smartwater-iot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Urban areas face daunting environmental, socioecological, and infrastructure challenges. Information and communications technology (ICT) promises unprecedented capabilities to enable cities to improve the quality of life, efficiency of urban operations and services, and competitiveness, while maintaining sustainable use of resources. Ubiquitous sensing, information processing, and wireless networks are quickly becoming embedded in the fabric of contemporary cities, and the Internet of Things (IoT) connects everyday objects and devices to network technologies. The proliferation of these technologies enables the advent of “Smart Cities” that utilize ICT, IoT, and big data analytics to address critical urban challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water supply and infrastructure are major areas of concern for American cities and grand challenges facing engineers. Urban areas are running out of clean reliable sources of water, and innovative solutions are needed for long-term planning [7]. The US drinking water infrastructure serves 315 million people and is in need of replacement, upgrading, and maintenance to continue to support projected population growth. The American Society of Civil Engineers rated drinking water infrastructure with a grade of D- in 2009 and D in 2013, while the American Water Works Association estimates the cost of repairing and expanding US drinking water infrastructure at over $1 trillion through 2035 or $1.7 trillion through 2050. Because of the lapse in infrastructure maintenance, 77 million people are served by more than 18,000 water systems with water quality violations (based on 2015 data), and 2.1 trillion gallons of water are lost annually due to aging and leaky pipes, broken water mains, and faulty meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising application for smart and connected communities is the use of ICT and IoT technologies to improve urban water supply management. The IoT can connect personal smart devices with faucets and pipelines that are embedded with sensors, actuators, and network connectivity to collect and report real-time information about water consumption, quality, and losses. A water-smart city can sustainably use and reuse water resources by adapting real-time operations and planning practices in response to ubiquitous sensor networks and disparate but interconnected and heterogeneous data streams. While a survey of the water industry shows that 33% of utilities are interested in real-time control and big data system analytics, water utilities have predominantly not harnessed these technologies,  due to a number of challenges associated with managing and analyzing big data. Technological gaps, workforce challenges, and community disengagement undermine the alignment of critical municipal management priorities with the analysis and application of smart water data. Installing data analytics systems can worsen data deluge, which is a serious challenge for municipalities, utilities, and their constituencies. The ubiquity of different types of sensors and data collection mechanisms obscures the issues with frequency and asynchronicity of data collection, the types of data generated, and gaps in datasets. Utilities that have installed smart meter systems need support to make sense of and apply data for decision-making, and applications are lacking that would demonstrate that the use of smart systems will support long-term sustainability and urban planning goals. The next generation smart water system should provide the analysis to guide water resources sustainability, stand as a first line of defense for communities that suffer from water quality issues, and catalyze a culture of water conservation within communities.&lt;/p&gt;
