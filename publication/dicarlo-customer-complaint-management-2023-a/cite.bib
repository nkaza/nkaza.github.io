 abstract = {Community water systems (CWSs) supply safe drinking water through pipes and other conveyances to the same population year-round. Complaint management is an important activity for CWSs and can assist efforts to monitor water quality and improve public perceptions. This research explores how CWSs receive, store, and use customer complaints. A new dataset is constructed through the distribution of an online survey. Respondents represent more than 500 CWSs across the U.S. and vary in characteristics, including the population size served. This research gives new insight about the tools that CWSs need and are willing to adopt for analyzing and reporting water quality issues.},
